# ARM-EMU-
A multi-cycle processor designed with the simulation software Digital designed to efficently process instructions through the processor 

Created with logic gates which are built up into full 8 bit ripple carry adders

AnalyzeDecode.dig analyzes the hex files of the unit test files which allows the processor to identify the instruction and then execute it accordingly

project07.dig holds the main processing cycles
